h1.entrySet() returns a set of entries from the HashMap h1. Each entry is a key-value pair where the key is a Character and the value is an Integer.
new ArrayList<>(h1.entrySet()) creates a new ArrayList containing all the entries from the HashMap.
The List<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> l1 is a list of map entries that allows us to manipulate and sort the entries more easily.

l1.sort(...) sorts the list l1 in place.
The sorting uses a lambda expression as a comparator: (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue()).
e1 and e2 are two entries (Map.Entry<Character, Integer>) being compared.
e2.getValue() gets the value (frequency) of the second entry.
e1.getValue() gets the value (frequency) of the first entry.
e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue()) compares the frequencies:
If e2.getValue() is greater than e1.getValue(), it returns a positive number, indicating that e2 should come before e1.
If e2.getValue() is less than e1.getValue(), it returns a negative number, indicating that e1 should come before e2.
If e2.getValue() is equal to e1.getValue(), it returns 0, indicating that their order does not need to be changed.
This results in sorting the list in descending order of frequencies.

h1 = {'e': 3, 'x': 1, 'a': 2, 'm': 1, 'p': 1, 'l': 1}
Convert to List:

h1.entrySet() returns a set of entries: [('e', 3), ('x', 1), ('a', 2), ('m', 1), ('p', 1), ('l', 1)].
new ArrayList<>(h1.entrySet()) converts this set into a list.
Sort the List:

Before sorting: [('e', 3), ('x', 1), ('a', 2), ('m', 1), ('p', 1), ('l', 1)].
After sorting: [('e', 3), ('a', 2), ('x', 1), ('m', 1), ('p', 1), ('l', 1)].
The sorted list now has entries ordered by their frequencies in descending order. This sorted list will be used in subsequent steps to distribute the letters to keys in a way that minimizes the total number of key presses.
